Gravity slingshot (gravity assist) class. Right now, in SolarSystem.java, in lines 359-371 there's a really ugly if-statement (with some double nested for loop in it). It shouldn't be there. We need a class that does the same thing, but more universal. It should know the list of planets from SolarSystem class and update it after each timestep. The calss should (at each timestep) check proximity of the probe to all planets (except Earth, Saturn and Titan). If the probe is close enough (I don't really know, say 1 000 000 km away for now), the class should take the velocity of the probe (velX and VelY) and add 60% of the planet's velocity to it.
